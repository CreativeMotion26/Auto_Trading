### **Overview**

Auto trading with Python typically involves using Python programming language to develop automated trading strategies for financial markets. These strategies can be based on various technical indicators, statistical analysis, machine learning models, or any other algorithmic approach to make trading decisions. GitHub is a popular platform where developers share their code and projects, including auto trading strategies.

### **Dependencies**

Review the dependencies and libraries used in the code. Commonly used libraries for auto trading in Python include pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computing, and various financial APIs like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, or Binance for accessing market data and executing trades.

    * pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    * numpy: For numerical computing and mathematical operations.
    * Binance API: For accessing market data and executing trades on the Binance exchange.


### **AI Prediction Model**

Understand the trading strategies implemented in the code. These strategies could be based on technical indicators like Moving Averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), Bollinger Bands, or more advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis.

    * Moving Averages
    * RSI (Relative Strength Index)
    * MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    * Bollinger Bands
    
Additionally, it may employ more advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis to make trading decisions.


### ****Tweets sentiment analysis****
Tweets Sentiment Analysis is a process of using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in tweets. The goal is to identify whether a tweet has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

**The process generally involves the following steps:**

*  1. Data Collection: Collecting tweets related to a specific topic or company using Twitter API or web scraping.
*  2. Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the tweet text by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and handling stopwords.
*  3. Sentiment Analysis: Using NLP techniques and machine learning models to classify the tweets' sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
*  4. Visualization: Presenting the sentiment analysis results through graphs or charts to provide insights into the overall sentiment towards the topic or company.
  





Keep in mind that auto trading involves real money and can be risky. Always thoroughly test any strategy on historical data and consider using paper trading or a practice account with real-time data before deploying it with real money. Additionally, be cautious when using code from GitHub or any other source, as it might not be thoroughly vetted, and it's essential to understand the code's logic and implications before running it.
